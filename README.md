👋 Hi, I'm Carolyn Martínez  

🎯 **Data Scientist Enthusiast!!**  
📍 Based in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic  

I’m passionate about using **data and analytics** to drive strategic business decisions and improve customer experiences.  
Currently pursuing my **Master’s in Data Science** while working on data-driven initiatives in the **banking industry**.  

## 🧠 Featured Projects 

# 💳 Credit Card Approval Prediction

## 📘 Project Overview
This project aims to build a **machine learning model** to predict whether a credit card application should be **approved or denied**, based on applicants’ demographic and financial characteristics.  
It was developed as part of a **Data Science Master's project** focused on credit risk evaluation.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Develop a **classification model** to evaluate credit card approval risk.
- Apply **data preprocessing**, **feature engineering**, and **balancing techniques**.
- Compare models such as **Random Forest** and **XGBoost**.
- Interpret results and visualize key insights for business use.

---

## 🧩 Dataset
The dataset includes information about applicants such as:
- Income and employment stability  
- Marital status and dependents  
- Previous credit history  
- Loan or credit amounts  

*(Data used for educational and non-commercial purposes.)*

---

## 🧹 Data Preparation
- Cleaned and transformed categorical and numerical variables.
- Handled missing values and outliers.
- Applied **SMOTE** to balance the target variable.
- Split data into training and testing sets.

## 🤖 Models and Techniques
| Technique | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| **Random Forest** | Used as baseline model for comparison |
| **XGBoost** | Tuned with GridSearchCV for optimal parameters |
| **Threshold Adjustment** | Modified cutoff for business-appropriate recall/precision balance |
| **Feature Importance** | Identified key drivers of approval decisions |

---

## 📊 Results
- **Best Model:** XGBoost  
- **Accuracy:** 0.89  
- **AUC:** 0.92  
- **Precision (Approved class):** 0.87  
- **Recall (Approved class):** 0.84  

---

## 📈 Key Insights
- Applicants with stable income and no previous defaults have the highest approval probability.  
- Credit amount and previous delinquencies are the strongest predictors.  
- Adjusting decision thresholds can reduce false approvals by ~10%.

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries
- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, XGBoost, Imbalanced-learn)
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- **Power BI** (visualizations and dashboards)

---

## 📚 Learnings
This project improved my understanding of:
- Applying ML for **credit risk assessment**
- Handling **imbalanced data**
- Translating **technical results into business strategy**
